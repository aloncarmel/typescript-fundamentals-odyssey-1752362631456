          - text: Welcome to the TypeScript Fundamentals Odyssey! ðŸŽ‰ As a coder, you might
              often find yourself wishing JavaScript was a bit more...
              predictable. That's where TypeScript enters the scene.
          - text: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles back to plain
              JavaScript. This means you can catch errors at compile time,
              saving you quite the headache!
          - text: "The idea is simple: by adding type safety, TypeScript improves the
              quality and maintainability of your code."
          - text: Want to see the benefits in action? Let's get rolling! Dive deeper by
              exploring [TypeScript's official
              site](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
