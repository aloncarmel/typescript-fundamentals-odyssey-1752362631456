learningObjectives:
  - Understand practical uses of interfaces in TypeScript.
hints:
  - Think about predictability in object creation and how interfaces guide
    structure.
  - Interfaces ensure adherence to intended designs. Here's more
    [insight](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html).

          - text: How can interfaces be beneficial in scenarios involving complex object
              structures?

            \    Please evaluate the user's answer in relation to
            the expected answer: Interfaces provide a clear contract for object
            structures, ensuring any object confirming to the interface has all
            the required properties, preventing possible runtime errors due to
            missing or incorrectly typed properties..

            \    # Assessment Criteria

            \    - Determine if the user's response demonstrates a
            clear understanding of the key concepts and ideas presented in the
            expected answer.

            \    - Consider synonyms, paraphrasing, and different
            phrasing that convey the same meaning.

            \    - Be flexible and focus on the essence of the
            answer rather than exact wording.

            \ \ 

            \    # Response Guidelines:

            \    - If the user's answer is correct or shows
            sufficient understanding, return 'correct: true'.

            \      - Provide a positive and affirming message,
            congratulating them and reinforcing their understanding.

            \    - If the user's answer is incorrect or incomplete,
            return 'correct: false'.

            \      - Gently explain why the answer is not fully
            correct or what may be missing.

            \      - Encourage them to try again, being empathetic
            and supportive.

            \ \ 

            \    # Tone and Style:

            \    - Use friendly and encouraging language.

            \    - Be empathetic to the user's learning process.

            \    - Focus on helping the user learn and understand
            the material.
